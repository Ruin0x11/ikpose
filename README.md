# ikpose

A 3D model poser that works in the browser.

[Live demo.](https://ruin0x11.github.io/ikpose/)

I want to use this as a replacement for sites like *posemaniacs* that only contain a static assortment of poses. Oftentimes there will be a specific pose I want to draw that I have in my mind, but cannot find a reference for after searching through what's available. Yet, beginners are pretty much always encouraged to draw with a reference of some kind, so I get stuck.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a dearth of 3D anatomical models that are useful for this purpose. I wish there was something like the 3D model at [pose-trainer.com](https://pose-trainer.com) that is available for general use.
