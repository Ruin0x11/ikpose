# ikpose

A 3D model poser that runs in the browser.

[Live demo.](https://ruin0x11.github.io/ikpose/)

I want to use this as a replacement for sites like *posemaniacs* that only contain a static assortment of poses. Oftentimes there will be a specific pose I want to draw that I have in my mind, but cannot find a reference for after searching through what's available. Yet, beginners are pretty much always encouraged to draw with a reference of some kind, so I get stuck.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a dearth of 3D anatomical models that are useful for this purpose. I wish there was something like the 3D model at [pose-trainer.com](https://pose-trainer.com) that is available for general use.

## Usage

Mouse over a joint and click on it to show the rotation controls. The purple joint is the root, and you can switch between translation and rotation controls by clicking on it more than once.

The red joints are the IK controllers. Clicking on them more than once will toggle between IK and joint controls.

## Credits

Most of the code was taken from [akjava/ThreeCharacterExamples](https://github.com/akjava/ThreeCharacterExamples) and cleaned up.
